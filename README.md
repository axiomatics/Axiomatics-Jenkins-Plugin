# Axiomatics-Plugin-Jenkins

This software is the beginning of an effort to integrate policy development - whether in
ALFA or regular XACML - with Jenkins.

Please note that this software is currently in Alpha and your feedback about improving this software is very much appreciated. 

## Current Features

Currently, the values are hardcoded, but:

- Build with Action that compiles policy in ALFA or XACML, packages it, and deploys it
to your Axiomatics Services Manager.

## Upcoming Features

- Parameterized input for your build through Jenkins
- Git integration

## Notes

Currently, the Git plugin is part of this plugin but testing needs to be done about how it
works with deployment.
